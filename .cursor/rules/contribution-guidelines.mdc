# Ladybird Contribution Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards

### Language and Style
- Write in **idiomatic C++23** using AK containers throughout
- Follow [CodingStyle.md](mdc:Documentation/CodingStyle.md) precisely
- Use `clang-format` for automatic formatting (correct version per `Meta/lint-clang-format.py`)
- Write in **American English** with ISO 8601 dates and metric units
- Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation
- Use authoritative and technical tone
- Avoid contractions, slang, idioms, humor, and sarcasm
- Use gender-neutral pronouns

### Code Clarity
- Choose expressive variable, function, and class names
- Make code intent as obvious as possible
- Check spelling in code, comments, and commit messages
- Don't include commented-out code

### What Not to Do
- Don't submit changes incompatible with 2-clause BSD license
- Don't touch anything outside PR scope
- Don't iterate excessively on design across multiple commits
- Don't use weasel-words like "refactor" or "fix" without explanation
- Don't write in C style - use C++ amenities
- Don't attempt large architectural changes until familiar with system
- Don't engage in "feng shui programming" (moving code without benefit)
- Don't add jokes to user-facing parts

## Commit Message Format

### Subject Line (First Line)
**Format:** `Category: Brief description of what's being changed`

**Rules:**
- Must be imperative mood: "Change the way X works" (not "Changed")
- Wrap at 72 characters
- No period at end
- Write in proper English with care and punctuation

**Category Guidelines:**
- Use library/application/service/utility name: `LibMedia`, `WebContent`, `CI`, `AK`, `js`
- Don't use generic categories like "Libraries" or "Utilities" (except for broad changes)
- Don't use specific component names (e.g., class names) - mention in summary instead
  - ✅ `LibGUI: Brief description of FooWidget changes`
  - ❌ `FooWidget: Brief description`
- Combine multiple categories with `+`: `LibJS+LibWeb+Browser: ...`

### Examples

```
LibWeb: Implement CSS grid layout algorithm

LibJS+LibWeb: Add support for async generators

RequestServer: Fix memory leak in HTTP connection pool

CI: Update GitHub Actions to latest versions
```

## Git Workflow

### Commit Structure
- Split changes into **atomic commits** (one feature/fix per commit)
- Each commit should leave build, tests, and system functioning
- Rebase commits on master branch
- Amend existing commits when adding changes after review

### Personal Contributions
- Add your copyright line to files when making substantive changes (optional but encouraged)

### Review Process
- Mark each review comment as "resolved" after pushing fix
- Engage with community on Discord for better review turnaround
- Advertise PRs in `#code-review` Discord channel

## Testing

- Include tests when fixing bugs or adding features when possible
- Import relevant [Web Platform Tests (WPT)](https://wpt.fyi/) if applicable
- Commit imported tests along with code changes

## Starting Out

### First Contributions
- **Start small** to get familiar with project and processes
- **Don't start with large components**
- Read all [Ladybird documentation](mdc:Documentation/README.md)
- Join [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nvfjVJ4Svh) for development discussion

### Getting Help
- Build problems: ask in `#build-problems` on Discord (not GitHub issues)
- Review requests: ping maintainers on Discord, not GitHub
- Development questions: ask in development channels on Discord

## Issue Policy

### When Filing Issues
- One issue per bug (don't combine multiple issues)
- Follow [detailed issue-reporting guidelines](mdc:ISSUES.md)
- No build issues or support requests in GitHub issues
- Keep comments relevant (no jokes or irrelevant commentary)

## Optimization and Media

### Images
- Run `optipng -strip all` on images to optimize and strip metadata
- Can reduce file size from KB to hundreds of bytes

## AI and LLM Usage

- AI assistance is acceptable BUT you're responsible for output quality
- AI-generated content must meet project standards
- Current AI output often too verbose and lower quality than human contributions
- Don't use AI to generate changes, respond to issues, or interact with PRs without meeting human-written content standards

## Project Values

### Neutrality
- Goal: build browser for everyone, regardless of opinions/worldviews
- Focus on shared goal of building the browser
- Welcome contributions from anyone committed to goals
- Keep discussions strictly related to browser development and web standards
- No platform for causes unrelated to browser development/web standards
- Discourage discussions on societal politics and divisive topics in project spaces

### Bad Faith
- Project reserves right to reject bad-faith issues and PRs
- Participating in social media brigading results in permanent ban
